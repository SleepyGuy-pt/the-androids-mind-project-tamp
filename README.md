TAMP takes out the Linux kernel that AOP uses and launches it separately.
Here's why TAMP is better than installing the whole AOSP tree
AOSP is literally 500 GB+ in terms of size, no matter how big your USB drive is, your not gonna fit it in, or even your computers storage.
so thats why TAMP is a thing, it takes out the linux kernel which is the "mind" of AOSP, its separate from AOSP.
TAMP is less than 2 GB.
Also, I know the struggle of going through AOSP's directories, its a very crappy feeling, the kernel is the most important part and its now simpler to navigate.
